Hello! I'm writing stuff. You might be wondering, why I'm writing stuff. The answer is pretty simple. I'm writing stuff to test stuff and i'm testing stuff; for I want to do stuff. My reason for wanting to do stuff is just that I like doing stuff. Why I like doing stuff althoug is something i don't know. It's just the case, but also it doesn't really matter; for all that matters is having fun, i.e. doing something.

Do you know what I would like? No, you don't, because how could you. I would like an exclamation-comma (& a question-comma). An exclamation-comma is a new punctation mark which is basically the line from an exclamtion mark above a comma. It does exactly, what you would think, it does. It describes an exclamation without ending the sentence.

I'm sorry, what are you doing exactly, Mr. SpielMitStil?

I like writing stuff and I am honestly not quite sure, why I like writing stuff.

Äpfel sind für Österreicher/-innen wichtig. A German sentence to find out, if the so called Umlaute (letters like ä, ö, ü) are processed correctly.

It seems that this thing works again, isn't that great, Mr. SpielMitSil?
